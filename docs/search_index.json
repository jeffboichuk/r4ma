["creating-a-canvas.html", "3.1 Creating a Canvas", " 3.1 Creating a Canvas The ggplot2 package is an interesting solution because it does not provide a set of chart types that you can pick and choose. For example, Microsoft Excel has always provided a limited set of scattercharts, bar charts, and other popular visualizations. In contrast, ggplot2 an extensible system of commands that build literally any picture you’d like to create. Talented R users have created ggplot masterpieces, such as, the picture of Hadley. Every visualization starts with a canvas. You can create a blank canvas with ggplot(). This takes argument such as data and mapping. You can think of the data as a pallete of information and the mapping as a plan for how to build the visual, but the function stops short of actually implementing it. "],
["geoms-and-aesthetics-aes.html", "3.2 Geoms and Aesthetics (aes)", " 3.2 Geoms and Aesthetics (aes) A geom is shorthand for a object on your plot. Definition/Derivation of geom? The geoms are the heart of the plot because they define whether the plot is a line plot, scatterplot, bar plot, etc. In each of these examples, the geom would be a line, a point or a bar and ggplot makes that very easy to remember. If you need a list of all the geoms, type geom_ in your console and press TAB. This will trigger the tab-completion feature in RStudio and show you the list of geoms that are available for you to use. "],

["transformation.html", "4 Preparing and Transforming Data", " 4 Preparing and Transforming Data It is a common adage that data analysts spend 80% of their time cleaning data and only 20% on value-add analysis. In this chapter we will show the basics of transforming data with the tidyverse package dplyr. Using these functions are the best way to reduce the overall amount of time spent on data cleaning and create reproducible workflows whenever you receive new data. "],
["selecting.html", "4.1 Selecting", " 4.1 Selecting It is common to have a dataset with more columns than you need or have helper columns that you’ve created but no longer need. Intuitively, the select function allows you to select only the columns that you want. [EXAMPLE HERE] The select function has the nice feature of also being able to rename columns as you select them. For example, [EXAMPLE HERE] There is another function in dplyr called rename(), however, this can conflict with a function in the plyr package also named rename() if you have both packages loaded at the same time. To avoid any confusion, reference the function you want using the package name and a double colon before the function like so, dplyr::rename(). This notation specifies the function and where to retrieve its definition, in this case, the dplyr package. "],

["summarizing.html", "4.3 Summarizing", " 4.3 Summarizing In the spirit of transforming data we will talk about summarizing it. A summary is just a transformation of underlying source data to a new form. Before summarizing data you must have an idea about HOW to summarize it first. Do you want to count rows, unique instances, calculate the COUNTIF/SUMIF/PIVOT -&gt; group_by() + summarize() In continuing with the references with Excel there is the capability to filter data in your summarizes, just how a Pivot Table allows you to identify variables to filter on. In a general sense, filtering just means that you remove any rows from a dataset that meet a certain criteria. "],
